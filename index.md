            <p>Dungeoncross was a game I made in sok stories, a very simple fantasy console where the only code you can write is like object + object (spawns) object. I managed to make a full ass roguelite in it, which is pretty cool  I think.</p>

            <p>I watched a miziziziz tutorial on making a platformer and thought I could make a full collectathon metroidvania. I was wrong, but I might revisit the idea one day because there's some potential, but I'd have to restart because the project files have been lost to time (that's code for a broken laptop)</p>

            <p>I wanted to start actually learning godot, so I started to make a 3D platformer and looked up a tutorial. Beyond adding a simple double jump, I did not actually learn godot. I made the placeholder assets of the skybox and the little t posing man, godspeed</p>

            <p>After giving up on the 3d platformer for being too hard to code, I'm not sure why I chose to make something harder instead. either way, im still working on this and learning bit by bit; the project looks a little different now but i dont feel like recording a new video bc you get the dealio, it's an indev vr game</p>
