            <p>this was the test render for an animation i was working on. i really liked it but i never wrote a script so it would never get finished basically, and everything i put into it was just shit i thought looked cool (which isnt a bad way to make things, but it doesnt work unless you already got a vision (and i did not have one))</p>

            <p>After giving up on the 3d platformer for being too hard to code, I'm not sure why I chose to make something harder instead. either way, im still working on this and learning bit by bit; the project looks a little different now but i dont feel like recording a new video bc you get the dealio, it's an indev vr game</p>
