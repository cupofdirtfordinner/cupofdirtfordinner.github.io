<h3 id="top">hi, im dirt. i have a few other versions of this portfolio, but i think it's more important i have all the shit i make here rather than a cool portfolio so it's easier to update in the future.</h3>

In the background is my favorite color, a sort of pink/coral. not sure how it looks on your screen but this color makes me happy when i see it (which is why it's a common theme in my work, you might notice).

Below is my favorite bird. I believe it is a Blue Hyacinnth Macaw, and it is my favorite bird because one time when I was working on the CSS for <a href="mesa.rip">mesa.rip</a> I needed a test image, and found this image upon googling the word "image" (or "picture", or something of the sort). Blue Hyacinth Macaws have been my go-to test image ever since. <br>
